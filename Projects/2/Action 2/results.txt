Remarks:
Multithreading seems to have an interesting effect with mergesort. When groups had a smaller number of threads, the spread of execution time 
among groups is more consistent. But with a larger number of threads for each group, the execution time decreased with each groups sort, 
especially for longer lists. For medium lists though, a medium number of threads per group seems to be the sweet spot for execution time.
