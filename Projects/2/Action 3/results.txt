Results: 4 threads are spawned and register custom signal handlers for SIGINT, SIGABRT, and SIGFPE. The ordering result from the fine tuning experiment from slowest to fastest is team 1, team 2, team 3, team 4. The status of teams 1 to 3 are outputted. Team 4 terminates the other teams, slowest first by sending signals that are registered by the custom signal handler. The signals are sent twice and all teams are terminated including the fastest team, team 4.
