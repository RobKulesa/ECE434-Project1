1)
SIGINT: 
Output- "Thread 4509453760 received signum: 2"
If SIGINT is recieved, as it is a part of threadfunc_sigaction,
sig_handler runs to deal with the signal. sig_handler will just print
the thread number and the signum of the recieved signal
(in this format: "Thread ____ received signum: ____"). sig_handler locks the mutex 
while this is happening.

SIGABRT:
Output- "Thread 4562181568 received signum: 6"
If SIGABRT is recieved, as it is a part of threadfunc_sigaction,
sig_handler runs to deal with the signal. sig_handler will just print
the thread number and the signum of the recieved signal
(in this format: "Thread ____ received signum: ____"). sig_handler locks the mutex 
while this is happening.

SIGILL:
Output- None
If SIGILL is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGCHLD: 
Output- None
If SIGCHLD is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGSEGV:
Output- None
If SIGSEGV is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGFPE:
Output- "Thread 4562181568 received signum: 8"
If SIGFPE is recieved, as it is a part of threadfunc_sigaction,
sig_handler runs to deal with the signal. sig_handler will just print
the thread number and the signum of the recieved signal
(in this format: "Thread ____ received signum: ____"). sig_handler locks the mutex 
while this is happening.

SIGHUP: 
Output- None
If SIGHUP is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGTSTP:
Output- None
If SIGTSTP is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 


2)

If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of threadfunc_sigaction,
sig_handler runs to deal with the signal. sig_handler will just print
the thread number and the signum of the recieved signal
(in this format: "Thread ____ received signum: ____"). sig_handler locks the mutex 
while this is happening.

SIGABRT:
Output-"Thread 123145476268032 received signum: 6"
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of threadfunc_sigaction,
sig_handler runs to deal with the signal. sig_handler will just print
the thread number and the signum of the recieved signal
(in this format: "Thread ____ received signum: ____"). sig_handler locks the mutex 
while this is happening.

SIGILL:
Output-None
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGCHLD: 
Output-None
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGSEGV:
Output-None
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGFPE:
Output-"Thread 123145478414336 received signum: 8"
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of threadfunc_sigaction,
sig_handler runs to deal with the signal. sig_handler will just print
the thread number and the signum of the recieved signal
(in this format: "Thread ____ received signum: ____"). sig_handler locks the mutex 
while this is happening.

SIGHUP: 
Output-None
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal. 

SIGTST:
Output-None
If this signal is recieved, as it is a part of ignore_sigaction,
sig_handler does not run to deal with the signal. Instead, the sigaction runs the SIG_IGN 
macro, which tells the code to ignore this signal.
